# 14 Days of Valentine's

## What is this?
This project is an advent calendar of sorts that you can self-host which lets you show your loved ones how much you appreciate them. It displays 14 doors, each with an image hidden behind them, that you can change to your desire. 

## How do I get started?
You currently have to either build the docker container locally, or just copy all the files into a folder and access the html file. Place each day, labelled 1 - 14, i.e. 1.png, 2.png etc. in the folder named doors. The card will automatically allow access on the day to that day's door.
